## Features

1. Start typing **lia** in your markdown document to see the extended help, that
   can be explored via fuzzy-searching. Hit Tab for inserting your selected
   snippet.
2. To ease the voice selection for different narrators, start typing **voice**
   and search through all possible voice settings.
3. Syntax highlighting help is offered if you start typing **hili** followed by
   your language of choice. Since LiaScript applies the ace-editor, there is a
   matching done between highlight.js and ace. You can select your language from
   highlight.js, but it will be translated into the text in parentheses.
