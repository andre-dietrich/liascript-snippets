      Surveys are defined similarly to quizzes by using brackets ([]). A text survey is defined by a multiple number three subsequent underscores (___) that are enclosed by double brackets. The number of underscores defines the number of lines a user has to fill out.

      Example:

        A single line text survey:

          [[___]]

        A two line text survey:

          [[___ ___]]

        And a six liner:

          [[___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ]]
